# Project Title

Code Institute - Milestone Project1: User Centric frontend Development.

My project is an author website. It serves two functions: firstly to act 
as shop window to potential readers, displaying books, videos and information
relevant to the author, and secondly, as a landing page whereby the author can grow
an email subscriber list based on a free book offering when email details are supplied. 
It's designed to be responsive on all devices. 


## Firstly

The site is hosted on GithHub Pages at https://github.com/nevdevtrev/project1-author-site.git
Should you wish to clone this simply use git clone https://github.com/nevdevtrev/project1-author-site.git 
in your terminal. 

You can see the publsihed live site [here] (https://nevdevtrev.github.io/project1-author-site/)

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. Boostrap 4.3.1
3. Flexbox Grid System
4. CSS3
5. JavaScript

## Design - UX

The design concept for this site was essentially this - 'clean and simple'. The purpose for the site was two-fold: firstly
as a shop window to the authors catalogue of books and contact information, but equally as a funnel for building up
a readership emailing list. An author's lifeblood is their readers so being able to compile an ever-growing contact 
database of their readers/fans is an essential tool for any author's marketing toolbox. To facilitate higher 
subscriber turnover I placed a simple email-input bootstrap toast utility on the initial landing page to the website. This is closeable,
and ignorable, for any exisiting subscribers but is front-of-house for all new visitors to the site. 

The site is designed as a single, multi-section, page with top navigation bar links (collapsible on small devices) to books, events, media,
blog, contact and author information. Sections are reached through a smooth scrollspy effect, again keeping the user
experience as simple and pleasant as possible. I've also utilised a fixed footer for quick access to author social links.

### Design Features

The core features implemented were built upont the flexbox grid layout system and include: bootstrap toast input, scrollspy with the
addition of java based smooth scrolling feature.
