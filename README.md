README.MD FOR PROJECT1.AUTHORSITE
Project
This is my first milestone project on HTML/CSS3/Bootstrap User Centric Frontend Development. I’ve decided on an author website primarily as this is something I personally intend to use for myself at some point. 
Design
I intend it to be a combination of a primary multi-segmented single main page, with additional separate pages. It will use:
•	HTML/CSS3/BOOTSTRAP 4
•	Flexbox grid system
•	Scrollspy 
Credit
I will acknowledge any and all aspects of this project which I’ve taken from, or has been inspired by other sources.
Wireframe
I intend to use marvel app to wireframe this fully 
Future Elaboration
Issues & Fixes
1.	Initial index.html would not recognise CSS styling. It seemed to be a bug as removing the index.html and recreating a new one fixed the problem
